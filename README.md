## Deployed Model

This lab mirrors what was done in the earlier lab using Flask. (The earlier 2 labs are in the project_Sherlock repository, and have the deliverables names app.py and test_flask.py... with initally 3 independent variables (Sherlock sensors) and a 4th arbitrary dependent variable. Details of these labs can be found in the README.md for that repo.) A new model had to be quickly created because the pickled model was not saved to github and subsequently over written. This new 'model' uses a single boolean independent variable is used to predict 'something'.  

Heroku is the hosting webserver and the predict route can be found at https://mysterious-reef-90699.herokuapp.com/predict
